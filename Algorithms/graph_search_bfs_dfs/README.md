#### Graph search (BFS and DFS)

In these two programs, as the names indicate, we perform two implementations of graph searching
algorithms, both quite efficient with O(n+m):

* Breadth-First Search (BFD) implementation

In the BFS algorithm, we steadilty discover the graph layer by layer starting from a vertex.

* Depth-First Search (DFS) implementation

In the DFS algorithm, we aggressively discover the graph through moving to the end of paths.
