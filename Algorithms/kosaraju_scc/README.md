#### kosaraju Algorithm

In these two programs, as the names indicate, we perform two implementations of the famous Kosaraju's algorithm
for computing the Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) of a directed graph:

* Iteration implementation

This implementation is quite efficient and works well for massive graphs.

* Recursion implementation

This implementation works quite well for small graphs; but will face performance issues as the graph surpasses
some limits in the number of vertices/edges.
