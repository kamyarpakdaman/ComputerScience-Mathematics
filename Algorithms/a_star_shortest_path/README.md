#### A* shortest path

In this program, we use Euclidan distane to implement the A* algorithm for finding the shortest
path from a start vertex to a target vertex. Unlike the Dijkstra's algorithm, A* is optimized
as a greedy algorithm fo follow the shortest path among some viabale options using the rough
estimations from each vertex to the target vertex.
