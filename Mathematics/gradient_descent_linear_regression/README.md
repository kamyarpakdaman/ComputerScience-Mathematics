#### Gradient Descent Linear Regression

In this program, we use the Gradient Descent method for performing Linear Regression. In this method, starting from given
values for b and m, we find the gradient at each step. The gradient guides us if we should increase or decrease any of b
and m to get to their optimal values. The process is repeated for a number of iterations to get to the optimal values.
